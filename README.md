## Key Components

1. **Isaac Sim**
- NVIDIA's Isaac Sim provides simulation environments to test and refine robotic applications in realistic virtual scenarios.
- Supports physics-based simulation, synthetic data generation, and ROS2 integration for end-to-end testing of navigation and perception systems.
  
2. **RTAB-Map**
- Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) is used for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). It supports 2D and 3D mapping using RGB-D sensors, LiDAR, or stereo cameras.
- Features include loop closure detection, memory management, and real-time map updates, making it ideal for dynamic environments.

3. **Navigation2**
- The Navigation2 (Nav2) stack enables autonomous navigation for mobile robots in complex environments.
- Includes robust path planning, obstacle avoidance, recovery behaviors, and real-time localization using techniques like AMCL and SLAM integration.

4. **RViz2**
- RViz2 is a powerful visualization tool in the ROS2 ecosystem, offering real-time rendering of robot states, -sensor data, maps, and navigation goals.
Facilitates debugging and system diagnostics with an intuitive GUI.
